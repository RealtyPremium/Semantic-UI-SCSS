### What this is

This is the much needed Semantic UI SASS port. Based on bootstrap-sass's converter.

### How to use

Just clone this repo to your local environment and run:

`rake convert`

That's it!!

The converter will automatically fetch the latest files from the Semantic UI repo and convert the LESS fils on the fly :)

After executing the rake task, you should see a new folder called `semantic`, inside which you will have sub-folders containing the converted SCSS files.
